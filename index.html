              At Country Road Stables, our goal is to provide an equine education in a fun, safe  and family-centric atmosphere. We offer year round instruction for beginners and  more advanced riders. We give 15 minute lessons for children ages 3-5 years old and   30-60 minute lessons for 5 years old to adult students.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lessons are taught 7 days per week. We charge $40 for 30 minute lessons and $70 for   60 minute lessons. We also offer a Lesson Package; if you pre-pay for 6 lessons you   receive a $20 discount!

          <span class="training">
            <p>
              We have X years of experience training young and green horses. We also train horses   with behavioral issues or horses that have become difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you would like to train your horse to become sound and calm undersaddle, teach your horse to jump, or have your horse become a veteran in the show ring, we can help!
            </p>
            <p>
              We have partnered with babies and green horses with some to no previous training, horses with behavioral issues (rearing, bucking, or unresponsiveness to aids - we've experienced it all!).
            </p>
            <p>
              We've also repurposed horses with varieties of backgrounds. For example, we trained a summer camp trail pony became an undersaddle show horse, a traditional dressage horse to jump, and have repurposed multiple off the track thoroughbreds to become English undersaddle horses.

          <span class="summer-programs">
            <p>
              We pack our day full with horse activities and riding lessons. Our summer programs are a great introduction to or a continued passion for a life of riding.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our program runs Monday to Friday; drop off is at 9:00 am and pick up at 3:00 PM. We provide snacks, juice, milk and water throughout the day. Each student should bring their own lunch, wear/pack long pants for riding, and wear a shoe with a small heel. We will provide ASTM certified helmets for all riders.
